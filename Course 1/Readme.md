### **Linked List**

- Learned about complexity for different operations
- Implemented linked list in python
- Implemented double linked list in python

### **Hash Table**

- Dictionaries underlying data structure is hash table(or hash map)
- We implemented normal hash table
- We implemented hash table handling collisions (Chaining and linear probing)
- Assignment related to this section is in the [link](https://github.com/codebasics/data-structures-algorithms-python/blob/master/data_structures/4_HashTable_2_Collisions/4_hash_table_exercise.md)
